### URDF Previewer

Open the package in the VS code and type Ctrl+Shift+X to go to the Marketplace and install the ROS extension. 
In order to use the ROS extension, first, go to a .urdf file (or .urdf.xacro file, either works), click on it, and then press Ctrl+Shift+P to be able to search for the extension usage.
As you type in ROS, the option ROS: Preview URDF will show up. Make sure to click on that option.
Once that option is clicked, you should be able to see what the model will look like. An example is shown below.
